title: Example Post
description: This frontmatter description will appear below the title
---

This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

```javascript
const PostPageStyled = styled('div', {});

const PostInfo = styled('div', {});

const PostContent = styled('main', {
  mt: '$12'
});
```

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.
